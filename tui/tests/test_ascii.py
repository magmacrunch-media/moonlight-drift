"""The plain-ASCII fallback, drawn through a real host.

``magmacrunch.engine.ui.glyphs`` decides what this terminal can encode and
``TuiRenderer`` substitutes on the way into the cell buffer, so nothing in
drift asks the question and nothing here can check it by reading the
source. These drive the game and read the buffer back.

Skipped against an older engine rather than failed: the module under test is
in the dependency, and a checkout running against an installed 0.5.0 has not
broken anything -- it just cannot see this yet.
